# ðŸš§ Still in Development

The main issue is that when the Colab server stops, the Minecraft world data can be lost. I'm currently researching a way to back up the world properly without confusing anyone.

Since this is using Google Colab Free Tier, the server can only run for up to 90 minutes before it gets disconnected automatically.
